Setup Instructions

Clone or Download the Project:

Ensure all files are placed in the correct directory structure as shown above.


Serve the Application:

Use a local web server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code, or python -m http.server 8000) to serve the index.html file.
Alternatively, open index.html directly in a browser, but note that some features (e.g., image loading) may require a server due to CORS restrictions.


Dependencies:

The project uses external CDNs for:
Tailwind CSS (https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tailwindcss/2.2.19/tailwind.min.css)
Font Awesome (https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0/css/all.min.css)
Google Fonts (Poppins: https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@100;200;300;400;500;600;700;800;900&display=swap)


Ensure an internet connection to load these resources.


Image Assets:

Place movie poster images in the img/ directory with the filenames referenced in js/script.js (e.g., m1.jpg, coming1.jpg, etc.).
The home section background image (home3.jpg) should also be placed in the img/ directory.



Features

Responsive Navigation: A hamburger menu for mobile devices that toggles a navigation bar.
Dynamic Movie Listings: Displays movies in "Opening this Week" and "Coming Soon" sections, populated from JavaScript arrays.
Newsletter Subscription: A simple email input field with a subscribe button.
Social Media Links: Footer with social media icons linking to placeholder URLs.
Scroll Effects: Header changes style on scroll, and navigation links close the menu on click.

Future Improvements

Add a backend API to fetch movie data dynamically.
Implement form submission for the newsletter subscription.
Add actual links for social media and sign-in functionality.
Improve accessibility (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA labels).
Optimize images and add lazy loading.

Notes

 
The className attribute in the HTML <div> tag is incorrect for vanilla HTML (it’s a React convention). It has been left as-is to preserve the original code but should be changed to class for standard HTML compliance.

Ensure the img/ directory contains all required images to avoid broken image links.



The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling, so familiarity with Tailwind classes is helpful for modifications.
